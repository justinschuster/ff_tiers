A seemingly easy touchdown went right through the hands of star WR Davante Adams, and Equanimeous St. Brown dropped a wide-open two-point conversion that would have made the score 28-25 late in the third. Down eight with a little over two minutes to play, the Packers elected to kick a field goal instead of trying to punch it in on fourth down from the six-yard line. Rodgers never got the ball back.
